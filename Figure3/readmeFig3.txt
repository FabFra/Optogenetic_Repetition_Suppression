"Continuous" contains data for the units excited during continuous photostimulation
"Pulse" contains data for the units excited during 50 Hz photostimulation

In each Matlab structure:

- cell "Mua" contains data for multi unit activity, cell "Su" for single units;

- "MeanFR" is the mean firing rate of the corresponding population, computed for 900 ms (stimulation onset after 300ms);
- "FR" contains the firing rate of each unit of the corresponding population;


Plotdata is the Matlab code for plotting the data as in Figure3 of the text.
