"CompS1" contains data for the condition with S1 consisting of a compound stimulus;
"VisS1" contains data for the condition with S1 consisting of a visual stimulus;
"S6A" contains the data for the control experiment (Fig S6A); it contains two structures, "Stim" for the condition with photo-stimulation and "NoStim" for the condition without photo-stimulation

In each of these structures:

- "PopFR" is the average firing rate; 
- "FR" contains the firing rate of each unit;
